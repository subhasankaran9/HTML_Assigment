        <b>VOYAGE TO THE FALLS BOAT TOUR</b>
      </h1>
      <p>
        The 20-minute Voyage to the Falls boat tour brings guests on the journey
        of a lifetime. Enjoy stunning views of the Niagara Gorge, American
        Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls, and come face-to-face with the famous
        Canadian Horseshoe Falls. Feel the thundering roar, awesome power, and
        amazing mist (a protective recyclable mist poncho is provided) that come
        along with these natural wonders or, ride after sunset for a light-mist
        experience with the illumination of the Fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tourists visiting Canadian Niagara Falls take the Hornblower Niagara
        Cruise while tourists to USA Niagara Falls take the Maid of the Mist.
        Visitors wishing to take both boat tours can do so by crossing the
        border (you should have valid travel documents)
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the best time to go for the Niagara Falls boat ride is either early
        in the morning or towards closing time. Book the Falls Fireworks Cruise
        if you want to see the fireworks display at 10:00 p.m.
      </p>
